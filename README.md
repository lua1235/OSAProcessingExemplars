# OSAProcessingExemplars
This is the source of a website to host an array of approved exemplars for processing assignments for the CompSci 10s attending Old Scona Academic Highschool.
In order to display student-written processing files on the webpage, processing.js was imported from the open-source repository https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js
