# OSAProcessingExemplars
This is the source of a website to host an array of approved exemplars for processing assignments for the CompSci 10s attending Old Scona Academic Highschool.

In order to display student-written processing files on the webpage, processing.js was imported from the open-source repository https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js

Although processing.js has been archived since December 2018, it still remained the most optimal method for this case, as the exemplar files are in Java and it would have been unfeasible to convert each into Javascript as would have been required by the more modern alternative, p5.js
